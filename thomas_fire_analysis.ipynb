    "## Purpose\n",
    "The Thomas Fires was a massife wildfire that affected Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017. \n",
    "The Thomas Fire destroyed at least 1,063 structures, while damaging 280 others; and the fire caused over $2.2 billion (2018 USD) in damages. As of August 2020, the Thomas Fire is California's tenth-most destructive wildfire. In this notebook we analyze the Air Quality Index that occured the time leading up to and after the Thomas Fire. We will create a map of the Thomas Fire perimeter to visualize the damage using `landsat 8` imagery "
